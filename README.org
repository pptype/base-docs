** Introduction

Right now, PPType has lots of public and internal documentation project, such
as:

- https://github.com/ppresume/docs-notes
- https://github.com/pptype/pandoc-markdown

We need a better foundation to make our workflow smooth, such as:

- How to install TeX/Pandoc in Windows/Linux/macOS? We need detailed
  documentation and reproducible workflows.
- Drive all workflow by [[https://github.com/ruby/rake][rake]] and [[http://guardgem.org/][guard]]
- Consistent workflows like:
  - ~rake tex~, generate TeX format
  - ~rake pdf~, generate PDF by compiling TeX document
  - ~rake jpg~, convert PDF to jpg images
    - Should add an optional param to control jpg image's density and quality
  - ~rake png~, convert PDF to png images
    - Same as jpg images, should add an optional param to control jpg image's
      density and quality
    - Besides, should add another param to control whether or not we should add
      a white background to png images
  - ~rake clean~ and ~rake clobber~ for cleaning intermediate temporary files
  - use ~guard~ to automate build when "source files" change
- Need a good choice of font for both English and Chinese
- Need tools like [[https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC][OpenCC]] to convert between Simplified Chinese and Traditional
  Chinese
- Various tunes for pandoc
  - Customize latex header file for both Chinese and English
  - Try pandoc's [[http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#smart-punctuation][smart-punctuation]] to ease writings for punctuation
  - Support multiple plain text format, at least for Markdown and Org-mode
- Integrate travis-ci and circle-ci for automatic documentation build
  - Need to figure out a better way to install texlive in various ci system
    since the whole "texlive-full" packages is about 1.7 GB, even for
    travis-ci/circle-ci, it still need SOME time to install this every time it
    compiles document for us. We need to install texlive-full for normal use,
    while for CI, just install a minimal tiny texlive distribution.
